## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

The document has parameters that can be determined by the URL served to the Shiny application. The defaults are defined in each document. Here are the parameters for this document:

Parameter | Value
------------- | -------------
one | `r params$one`
two | `r params$two`
three | `r params$three`
four | `r params$four`
five | `r params$five`


You can change these parameters by changing the URL, for instance try to visit: https://ericscheier.shinyapps.io/qualtricsreports/?one=10&two=20&three=30&four=40&five=50

When you click the download or email buttons to the left, a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
# code is shown for reference but can be hidden
params$one + params$two + params$three + params$four
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars[sample(nrow(cars), params$five), ])
```

Note that the number of datapoints in the above plot is determined by the URL parameter "five", which is currently set to equal `r params$five`.
